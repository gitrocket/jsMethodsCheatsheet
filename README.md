This is an interactive JS Methods Cheatsheet. Mouseover and mouseout events invoke scale animation of the buttons, which display the definition of each item when clicked.

Animation and definitions updates are written in vanilla JavaScript.

This is a good introduction to JavaScript events.

Concepts covered: flexbox, grid, JavaScript date objects, adding a single event listener to multiple elements, the event object and target property.
